## Introduction
Uncertainty modeling is a crucial aspect of predictive modeling, especially in fields that rely on probabilistic forecasts. This project demonstrates how Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to estimate probabilities in uncertain scenarios, and how distribution fitting techniques, such as the Method of Moments and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), can be employed to model data distributions.

## Project Structure
This repository contains:
- **`uncertainty_modeling_monte_carlo_and_distribution_fitting.ipynb`**: The main notebook with detailed code and explanations.
- **`Advertising.csv`**: Dataset used for demonstrating uncertainty modeling techniques (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).
- **`data/`**: (Optional) Folder to store additional datasets if needed.
- **`output/`**: (Optional) Folder to save generated figures or tables.

## Dataset
The **Advertising.csv** dataset provides data on advertising spends across various channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding sales. It is used in this project to demonstrate distribution fitting techniques and analyze uncertainty in marketing data.

**Dataset Columns**:
- **TV**: Advertising budget allocated to TV.
- **Radio**: Advertising budget allocated to Radio.
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget allocated to Newspaper.
- **Sales**: Resulting sales generated.

This dataset is a valuable example for showcasing how statistical techniques can model and predict outcomes in marketing investments.

## Key Methods
1. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
   - A probability estimation technique using simulated random events.
   - Example: Estimating the probability of heads in a coin toss.

2. **Distribution Fitting**:
   - **Gamma Distribution**: Modeling data using the Gamma distribution.
   - **Method of Moments**: Using sample moments to estimate distribution parameters.
   - **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Estimating parameters to maximize the likelihood of observed data.

3. **Bootstrap Method**:
   - Estimating parameter variability by sampling with replacement.
   - Provides insights into parameter bias and variance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Histograms and density plots to illustrate data distribution and fit quality.
   - Comparative histograms for bootstrapped parameter estimates.

## Results and Visualization
- **Probability Estimation**: Monte Carlo methods successfully estimate the probability of uncertain events.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Method of Moments and MLE yield different parameter estimates; the notebook compares these and discusses fit quality.
- **Bootstrapping**: Parameter variability is visualized, highlighting the reliability of different estimation methods.
